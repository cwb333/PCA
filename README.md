# PCA
This is a shiny app to perform principal components analysis (PCA).  [Click here](https://christopherbeaver.shinyapps.io/pca2/) to run the app on the shiny cloud.  For the app to run correctly, the first column should be categorical data.  The remaining columns should be numerical data.  To run the app, download all the attatched files and folders, open the app.R file in RStudio IDE, and click the "run app" button in the top right area above the script.

RStudio desktop is freely available if you do not have an IDE to run the code.  [Click here](https://posit.co/downloads/) to download RStudio desktop for your operating system.  You will also need to have the R project for statistical computing installed to run RStudio desktop.
